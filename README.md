In the spring of 2024, I graduated with my BS in mathematics, a concentration in applied and computational mathematics, and a minor in physics from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. As an undergraduate, I involved myself in a few different research projects. These included the mathematical model of liquid metals (North Carolina State University) and machine learning for numerical solutions to partial differential equations (University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and Clarkson University).

As of fall 2024, I will be starting my PhD in mechanical engineering and applied mechanics at the University of Pennsylvania, advised under Dr. Paris Perdikaris, where I will be working on scientific machine learning.
